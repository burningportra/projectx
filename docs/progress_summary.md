# ProjectX Trading System Progress Summary

## Completed Components

### Market Data Pipeline
- ✅ Historical data download and storage
- ✅ Integration with ProjectX Gateway API
- ✅ Support for multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- ✅ Real-time data processing with WebSocket connection
- ✅ TimescaleDB integration for efficient time-series storage
- ✅ SQLite fallback for development and testing
- ✅ Prisma ORM integration for accessing data from JavaScript/TypeScript

### Rule Engine
- ✅ Core rule evaluation engine
- ✅ Multiple price-based comparison operators (>, <, ==, >=, <=, cross_above, cross_below)
- ✅ Support for relative price comparisons (compare to previous bars)
- ✅ Time windows for trading hours
- ✅ JSON-based strategy persistence
- ✅ Strategy lifecycle management (creation, activation, deactivation, emergency stop)
- ✅ Rule set evaluation with multiple rules

### Position Management
- ✅ Position model and state tracking (open, closing, closed)
- ✅ Order creation and lifecycle management
- ✅ P&L calculation (both realized and unrealized)
- ✅ Strategy executor for rule-to-order conversion
- ✅ Position closing and risk enforcement
- ✅ Event-based architecture with callbacks

### Main Application
- ✅ Initialization of all components
- ✅ Bootstrapping historical data
- ✅ Real-time data processing
- ✅ Strategy evaluation loop
- ✅ Callbacks for trade and bar events
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Integration of rule engine with position management

## Next Steps

### Web Frontend
1. Set up Next.js project structure
2. Implement authentication system
3. Create strategy configuration UI
4. Build position monitoring dashboard
5. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time updates

### Advanced Rule Engine Features
1. Implement technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.)
2. Add cross-timeframe rule dependencies
3. Create strategy backtest functionality
4. Implement optimization algorithms for strategy parameters

### Infrastructure
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated tests
2. Create Docker compose for easy deployment
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Add data retention and archiving policy

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Implement basic position management
- Start Next.js web frontend
- Add Prisma integration for strategy data

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)
- Complete web frontend with strategy builder UI
- ✅ Implement order execution logic
- Add technical indicators to rule engine
- Create position monitoring dashboard

### Long-term (2-3 months)
- Implement backtesting functionality
- Add strategy optimization
- Create comprehensive risk management system
- Deploy to production environment

## Test Results

All tests for the rule engine, strategy service, and position management are passing. The system now has both strategy rule evaluation and position management functionality fully integrated. 

The next major focus area will be the web frontend development to provide a user interface for monitoring positions and configuring strategies.
