      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the OrderManager.processBar signature update and fallback logic implementation into specific subtasks covering method signature modification, fallback logic implementation, and backward compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves modifying a method signature and implementing fallback logic, which has moderate complexity due to the need for backward compatibility. The cyclomatic complexity will increase slightly with the additional conditional logic for fallback behavior."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the market order fill logic implementation into subtasks covering the sub-bar data processing, fill price determination, and timestamp assignment logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing new logic for market order fills using sub-bar data, which adds moderate complexity. The implementation needs to handle conditional logic for when sub-bar data is available and determine appropriate fill prices and timestamps."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Limit Order Fill Logic with Sub-Bar Data",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the limit order fill logic implementation into subtasks covering buy limit order logic, sell limit order logic, price determination, and timestamp assignment.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing more complex conditional logic for limit orders with different behaviors for buy vs. sell orders. The need to iterate through sub-bars to find triggering conditions increases the cyclomatic complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Standalone Stop Order Fill Logic with Sub-Bar Data",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the stop order fill logic implementation into subtasks covering buy stop order logic, sell stop order logic, price determination, and timestamp assignment.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the limit order task, this implementation requires complex conditional logic with different behaviors for buy vs. sell stop orders. The iteration through sub-bars and condition checking increases cyclomatic complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement SL/TP OCO Order Fill Logic with Sub-Bar Data",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the SL/TP OCO order fill logic implementation into subtasks covering long position SL/TP logic, short position SL/TP logic, trigger precedence determination, OHLC sequence analysis, fill price calculation, timestamp assignment, and order cancellation.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task in the set, involving sophisticated conditional logic, sequential evaluation of sub-bars, position-dependent behavior, precedence rules, and order cancellation. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to the multiple nested conditions and edge cases that must be handled."

      "taskTitle": "Update BacktesterPage.tsx to Pass Sub-Bar Data",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the BacktesterPage.tsx update into subtasks covering data preparation logic and integration with OrderManager.processBar.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, involving modifications to pass additional data to an existing method. The complexity is low to moderate as it primarily involves adjusting data handling logic rather than implementing new algorithmic behavior."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Test Suite for New Fill Logic",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the test suite development into subtasks covering market order tests, limit order tests, stop order tests, SL/TP OCO order tests, edge case tests, and fallback scenario tests.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive test suite for all the new fill logic is highly complex due to the need to cover multiple order types, edge cases, and scenarios. The task requires deep understanding of all implemented behaviors and careful validation of outcomes across many test cases."
