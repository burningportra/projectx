# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update Existing Unit Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify existing unit tests for strategies and OrderManager to align with the refactored implementation.
# Details:
1. Review all existing unit tests for strategies and OrderManager.
2. Update tests to reflect new method signatures and logic flow.
3. Add new tests to cover refactored functionality, especially around P&L calculation and trade finalization.
4. Ensure all tests pass with the refactored implementation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run existing test suite and identify failing tests.
2. Systematically update each failing test to align with new implementation.
3. Add new tests for added or significantly changed functionality.
4. Verify full test coverage of refactored code.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Existing Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current test suite to understand coverage and identify tests affected by recent code changes or refactoring.
### Details:
Catalog all existing tests, note which areas of the codebase they cover, and flag any tests that may be impacted by new logic or methods.

## 2. Update Tests for New Logic and Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Modify existing tests to align with updated or newly introduced logic and methods resulting from the refactor.
### Details:
Ensure that all tests accurately reflect the current behavior of the codebase, updating assertions and test data as needed.

## 3. Add New Tests for Refactored Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop additional tests to cover new or significantly changed features introduced during the refactor.
### Details:
Identify gaps in test coverage created by the refactor and write new unit, integration, or end-to-end tests as appropriate.

## 4. Verify Full Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Run the complete test suite and use coverage tools to confirm that all new and updated logic is thoroughly tested.
### Details:
Analyze coverage reports, address any uncovered code, and ensure all tests pass to prevent regression errors.
