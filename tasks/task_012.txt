# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Enhanced TrendAnalyzer Class
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an Enhanced TrendAnalyzer class that wraps the existing TrendIdentifier and provides trader-friendly derived signals based on trend starts, including methods for accessing recent trend starts, identifying strengthening trends, calculating trend duration and magnitude, and finding trend starts that created highest highs or lowest lows.
# Details:
1. Create a new class called EnhancedTrendAnalyzer that encapsulates the existing TrendIdentifier.

2. Implement a constructor that takes a TrendIdentifier instance as a parameter:
   ```typescript
   constructor(private trendIdentifier: TrendIdentifier) {}
   ```

3. Develop the following public methods:
   a. getRecentTrendStarts(count: number): TrendStart[]
      - Returns the most recent 'count' number of trend starts.
   
   b. identifyStrengtheningTrends(threshold: number): TrendStart[]
      - Identifies trends that are gaining strength based on a given threshold.
   
   c. calculateTrendDuration(trendStart: TrendStart): number
      - Calculates the duration of a trend in terms of time periods or candles.
   
   d. calculateTrendMagnitude(trendStart: TrendStart): number
      - Calculates the magnitude of a trend (e.g., price change from start to current).
   
   e. findExtremeTrendStarts(): { highestHigh: TrendStart, lowestLow: TrendStart }
      - Identifies trend starts that led to the highest high and lowest low.

4. Implement private helper methods as needed, such as:
   - isStrengthening(trendStart: TrendStart, threshold: number): boolean
   - calculatePriceChange(start: number, end: number): number

5. Ensure all methods properly handle edge cases, such as insufficient data or no trends identified.

6. Implement error handling and input validation for all public methods.

7. Optimize the class for performance, considering caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

8. Document the class and its methods using JSDoc comments.

9. Integrate the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer with the Strategy Fluent Builder Pattern (from Task 11) to allow easy incorporation of trend analysis in strategy creation.

10. Create example usage scenarios to demonstrate how traders can leverage the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer in their strategies.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   a. Write tests for each public method of EnhancedTrendAnalyzer.
   b. Test edge cases (e.g., empty data, single trend, multiple trends).
   c. Verify correct handling of invalid inputs.

2. Integration Tests:
   a. Test EnhancedTrendAnalyzer with actual market data.
   b. Verify integration with Strategy Fluent Builder Pattern.

3. Performance Tests:
   a. Benchmark the performance of EnhancedTrendAnalyzer methods.
   b. Ensure efficient handling of large datasets.

4. Functional Tests:
   a. Create a sample trading strategy using EnhancedTrendAnalyzer.
   b. Backtest the strategy to verify correct trend analysis.

5. Code Review:
   a. Conduct a thorough code review to ensure clean, maintainable code.
   b. Verify proper error handling and documentation.

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   a. Have experienced traders review and test the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer functionality.
   b. Gather feedback on the usefulness and accuracy of the derived signals.

7. Regression Testing:
   a. Ensure that the introduction of EnhancedTrendAnalyzer doesn't break existing functionality.
   b. Verify that the underlying TrendIdentifier still works as expected.

8. Documentation Review:
   a. Review and validate the API documentation for completeness and clarity.
   b. Ensure example usage scenarios are correct and helpful.
