# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop integration tests to verify correct interaction between OrderManager, strategies, and UI components.
# Details:
1. Design test scenarios that cover the entire flow from strategy signal to UI display.
2. Implement integration tests using a testing framework suitable for TypeScript and React.
3. Include tests for various trading scenarios, including multiple open positions, different order types, and edge cases.
4. Verify that P&L and trade statistics are consistently reflected across all components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Use a mocking library to simulate market data and order executions.
2. Run integration tests in a controlled environment that mimics production setup.
3. Verify data consistency across OrderManager, strategies, and UI components.
4. Include performance benchmarks to ensure the refactored system maintains or improves efficiency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document comprehensive test scenarios covering the strategy, OrderManager, and UI flow, including both positive and negative cases.
### Details:
Define the scope of integration, enumerate all possible interactions between components, and ensure scenarios reflect real-world and edge cases.

## 2. Mock Market Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop and configure mock market data feeds to simulate various market conditions for testing purposes.
### Details:
Create mock data sources that can be controlled and manipulated to test different trading scenarios and system responses.

## 3. Implement Integration Tests for Strategy-OrderManager-UI Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop automated integration tests that validate the end-to-end flow between the strategy, OrderManager, and UI components.
### Details:
Write and automate test cases based on the designed scenarios, ensuring all interfaces and data exchanges are exercised.

## 4. Test Multiple Trading Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Execute integration tests across a variety of trading scenarios, including normal, edge, and failure cases.
### Details:
Run tests simulating different order types, market conditions, and user actions to validate system robustness.

## 5. Verify Data Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Check that data remains consistent and accurate across all system layers during and after test execution.
### Details:
Validate that order states, trade executions, and UI displays are synchronized and correct throughout the flow.

## 6. Run Performance Benchmarks [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Measure and analyze the performance of the integrated system under various loads and trading scenarios.
### Details:
Conduct stress and load tests to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system meets performance requirements.

## 7. Document Test Results [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compile and document the outcomes of all integration tests, including issues found, resolutions, and performance metrics.
### Details:
Prepare detailed reports for stakeholders, summarizing test coverage, results, and recommendations for improvements.
