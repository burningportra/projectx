# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Centralized Cache System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: The Centralized Cache System is now fully implemented and tested. The Cache class serves as the single source of truth for all trading data, including bars, orders, positions, strategy state, indicators, and performance metrics. It integrates with the MessageBus for automatic updates and provides a subscription mechanism for real-time UI updates. All required functionality is complete and validated by a comprehensive test suite.
# Details:
1. The Cache class is implemented with the following features:
   - Market data storage (bars by symbol/timeframe)
   - Order management (add, update, query by status)
   - Position tracking (open/closed positions with P&L calculation)
   - Strategy state and indicator storage
   - Performance tracking (balance, equity curve, unrealized P&L)
   - Subscription mechanism for real-time updates
   - MessageBus integration for automatic updates
2. Comprehensive test suite (Cache.test.ts) created with 18 tests covering all major features:
   - Market data management
   - Order management
   - Position management with P&L calculations
   - Strategy state management
   - Indicator management
   - Performance tracking
   - Subscription mechanism
   - Reset functionality
   - Thread safety and performance (10,000+ operations)
3. All tests are passing, validating the Cache system as the single source of truth for trading data.

# Test Strategy:
1. All cache operations (add, update, query, subscribe) are covered by unit tests.
2. MessageBus integration tested by publishing events and verifying cache updates.
3. Subscription mechanism tested with mock UI components.
4. Performance verified under high-frequency updates (10,000+ operations).
5. Data consistency verified across concurrent operations.
6. All tests in Cache.test.ts are passing, confirming system correctness.
