# Task ID: 16
# Title: Migrate UI Components to New Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Update BacktesterPage.tsx and related UI components to use the new BacktestEngine, Cache subscriptions, and MessageBus events.
# Details:
1. Replace direct strategy processing in BacktesterPage with BacktestEngine usage.
2. Subscribe UI components to Cache updates instead of maintaining local state.
3. Use MessageBus events for user actions (play/pause, order cancellation).
4. Update chart components to receive data from Cache subscriptions.
5. Refactor results panels to display Cache-provided metrics.
6. Ensure smooth real-time updates during playback.
7. Maintain backward compatibility during transition.
8. Update error handling to work with new architecture.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test UI responsiveness to Cache updates.
2. Verify correct rendering of all data from new sources.
3. Test user interactions through MessageBus.
4. Ensure no regressions in UI functionality.
5. Performance test UI updates during fast playback.
