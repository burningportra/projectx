      "description": "Develop a concrete strategy class that extends BaseStrategy, implementing a simple moving average (SMA) crossover trading approach with configurable parameters.",
      "details": "1. Create a new class `SmaCrossoverStrategy` that extends `BaseStrategy`:\n```typescript\nclass SmaCrossoverStrategy extends BaseStrategy {\n  private fastSMA: SimpleMovingAverage;\n  private slowSMA: SimpleMovingAverage;\n  private enhancedTrendAnalyzer: EnhancedTrendAnalyzer;\n\n  constructor(\n    private fastPeriod: number,\n    private slowPeriod: number,\n    private trendStrengthThreshold: number\n  ) {\n    super();\n    this.fastSMA = new SimpleMovingAverage(fastPeriod);\n    this.slowSMA = new SimpleMovingAverage(slowPeriod);\n    this.enhancedTrendAnalyzer = new EnhancedTrendAnalyzer(new TrendIdentifier());\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Implement the `onTick` method to process new price data:\n```typescript\nonTick(tick: Tick): void {\n  const fastSMA = this.fastSMA.update(tick.close);\n  const slowSMA = this.slowSMA.update(tick.close);\n  \n  if (fastSMA > slowSMA && this.enhancedTrendAnalyzer.isTrendStrengthening(tick.timestamp, this.trendStrengthThreshold)) {\n    this.enterLong(tick);\n  } else if (fastSMA < slowSMA && this.enhancedTrendAnalyzer.isTrendStrengthening(tick.timestamp, this.trendStrengthThreshold)) {\n    this.enterShort(tick);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement entry methods using the OrderManager:\n```typescript\nprivate enterLong(tick: Tick): void {\n  if (!this.position.isLong()) {\n    if (this.position.isShort()) {\n      this.orderManager.closePosition(this.position);\n    }\n    const quantity = this.calculatePositionSize(tick.close);\n    this.orderManager.submitOrder({\n      symbol: tick.symbol,\n      quantity,\n      side: 'buy',\n      type: 'market'\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nprivate enterShort(tick: Tick): void {\n  // Similar to enterLong, but for short positions\n}\n```\n\n4. Implement position sizing and risk management:\n```typescript\nprivate calculatePositionSize(currentPrice: number): number {\n  const accountBalance = this.orderManager.getAccountBalance();\n  const riskPerTrade = 0.01; // 1% risk per trade\n  const stopLossPercent = 0.02; // 2% stop loss\n  const positionSize = (accountBalance * riskPerTrade) / stopLossPercent;\n  return Math.floor(positionSize / currentPrice);\n}\n```\n\n5. Implement a method to handle order fills:\n```typescript\nonOrderFill(fill: OrderFill): void {\n  super.onOrderFill(fill);\n  if (fill.side === 'buy') {\n    const stopLossPrice = fill.price * 0.98; // 2% stop loss\n    const takeProfitPrice = fill.price * 1.04; // 4% take profit\n    this.orderManager.submitOrder({\n      symbol: fill.symbol,\n      quantity: fill.quantity,\n      side: 'sell',\n      type: 'stop',\n      stopPrice: stopLossPrice\n    });\n    this.orderManager.submitOrder({\n      symbol: fill.symbol,\n      quantity: fill.quantity,\n      side: 'sell',\n      type: 'limit',\n      limitPrice: takeProfitPrice\n    });\n  }\n  // Similar logic for short positions\n}\n```\n\n6. Implement configurable parameters using the Strategy Fluent Builder pattern:\n```typescript\nconst smaCrossoverStrategy = new StrategyFluentBuilder()\n  .setName('SMA Crossover')\n  .addIndicator('fastSMA', new SimpleMovingAverage(10))\n  .addIndicator('slowSMA', new SimpleMovingAverage(20))\n  .setEntryCondition((indicators, tick) => \n    indicators.fastSMA.getValue() > indicators.slowSMA.getValue())\n  .setExitCondition((indicators, tick) => \n    indicators.fastSMA.getValue() < indicators.slowSMA.getValue())\n  .setRiskManagement({\n    stopLossPercent: 0.02,\n    takeProfitPercent: 0.04,\n    riskPerTradePercent: 0.01\n  })\n  .build();\n```\n\n7. Ensure the strategy uses the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer for additional trend analysis and decision making.",
      "testStrategy": "1. Unit Tests:\n   - Create unit tests for each method in the SmaCrossoverStrategy class.\n   - Test the SMA calculations with known data series.\n   - Verify that entry and exit conditions are correctly identified.\n   - Test position sizing calculations with various account balances and prices.\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Create a test suite that simulates a series of price ticks.\n   - Verify that orders are correctly submitted to the OrderManager.\n   - Check that stop-loss and take-profit orders are placed after entry orders are filled.\n   - Ensure that the strategy correctly uses the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer for decision making.\n\n3. Backtesting:\n   - Implement a backtesting framework if not already available.\n   - Run the strategy against historical data for multiple symbols and timeframes.\n   - Compare the performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown) with benchmark strategies.\n\n4. Edge Cases:\n   - Test the strategy's behavior during rapid price movements and high volatility.\n   - Verify correct handling of scenarios where the fast SMA and slow SMA are very close in value.\n   - Ensure proper error handling for invalid input parameters.\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure the execution time of the onTick method to ensure it can handle high-frequency data.\n   - Profile memory usage to identify any potential memory leaks.\n\n6. Configuration Testing:\n   - Verify that the strategy can be correctly configured using the StrategyFluentBuilder.\n   - Test different combinations of SMA periods and risk management parameters.\n\n7. Dependency Verification:\n   - Ensure that the strategy correctly integrates with the EnhancedTrendAnalyzer.\n   - Verify that the OrderManager is used correctly for all order submissions and position management.\n\n8. Logging and Monitoring:\n   - Implement comprehensive logging for all strategy decisions and actions.\n   - Create a dashboard or reporting mechanism to visualize the strategy's performance over time.",
