# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Advanced Order Types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend OrderManager to support advanced order types including stop-limit, trailing stops, and bracket orders.
# Details:
1. Add support for stop-limit orders with separate trigger and limit prices.
2. Implement trailing stop orders with dynamic stop price adjustment.
3. Create bracket order functionality (entry + stop loss + take profit).
4. Add OCO (One-Cancels-Other) order groups.
5. Implement order time-in-force options (GTC, GTD, FOK, IOC).
6. Update order processing logic to handle new order types.
7. Ensure MessageBus events cover all new order states.
8. Update UI components to display and manage advanced orders.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each order type with various market scenarios.
2. Verify correct trigger and execution logic.
3. Test order group behavior (OCO, brackets).
4. Validate time-in-force enforcement.
5. Test edge cases and order interactions.
