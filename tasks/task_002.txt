# Task ID: 2
# Title: Finalize BaseStrategy Abstract Class for Advanced Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Review and finalize the existing BaseStrategy abstract class (in web/src/lib/strategies/BaseStrategy.ts) to ensure it fully supports upcoming features like the Strategy Fluent Builder and Enhanced TrendAnalyzer. This includes verifying its P&L calculations, trade management, order handling, configuration system, and extensibility points. Ensure all necessary hooks and common functionalities are robust and well-documented to serve as a solid foundation for all derived strategies.
# Details:
1. Review and update existing methods in BaseStrategy to ensure compatibility with OrderManager.
2. Verify and enhance P&L calculation methods.
3. Implement or improve trade management functionalities.
4. Refine order handling processes.
5. Develop a robust configuration system for strategy parameters.
6. Create clear extension points for derived strategies.
7. Ensure comprehensive documentation for all methods and properties.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests for all methods in BaseStrategy.
2. Create integration tests to verify BaseStrategy's interaction with OrderManager and other components.
3. Test various scenarios of trade execution, including entry, exit, and P&L calculation.
4. Verify that the strategy correctly handles different configuration parameters.
5. Ensure all extension points are properly tested with mock derived strategies.
