### Phase 3: Strategy Logic & Simulation ✅ COMPLETE

This is the next major phase to implement actual backtesting functionality:

- [ ] **Translate Python Strategy (`trend_models.py`) to TypeScript**
    - [ ] Translate `Bar` class to TypeScript (align with `BacktestBarData`)
    - [ ] Translate `State` class and its methods (e.g., `_reset_pending_uptrend_signal_state`, `set_new_pending_downtrend_signal`, etc.)
    - [ ] Translate core trend detection and signal generation logic (e.g., `confirm_uptrend`, `confirm_downtrend`)
    - [ ] Create a `StrategyService.ts` or custom React hook (e.g., `useBacktestStrategy`)
    - [ ] Ensure accurate handling of bar indexing and historical data access
- [ ] **Implement Core Backtesting Loop**
    - [ ] Function to process one bar at a time from the fetched `BacktestBarData[]`
    - [ ] Update TypeScript `State` object on each bar
    - [ ] Generate `StrategySignal`s (PUS, PDS, CUS, CDS) based on strategy logic
- [ ] **Simulate Trades**
    - [ ] Maintain list of open positions (`SimulatedTrade[]`)
    - [ ] Simulate trade entry/exit based on CUS/CDS signals
    - [ ] Implement P&L calculation (entry vs exit price, commission)
- [ ] **Update `ResultsPanel.tsx` with Live Metrics**
    - [ ] Calculate total P&L, win rate, total trades from `SimulatedTrade[]`
    - [ ] Update metrics during playback simulation
- [ ] **Plot Trade Markers on `TradeChart.tsx`**
    - [ ] Add buy/sell markers using `setMarkers()` on series
    - [ ] Differentiate entry/exit markers visually
    - [ ] Show trade P&L on hover/click
