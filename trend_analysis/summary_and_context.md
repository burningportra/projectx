Okay, here's a summary of our current status and context for a new chat:

**Goal:**
We are developing a Python script (`trend_analysis/trend_analyzer.py`) to analyze OHLC bar data from a CSV (`data/MNQ Bar Data(2019-05-06-2019-8-14).csv`). The script aims to identify and log "Potential" and "Confirmed" trend starts (uptrends and downtrends) for each bar. The target output is to match a manually created reference log (`data/MNQ bar count trend starts.txt`) that specifies these events along with bar numbers and dates.

**Current Script Logic Overview (Key Changes Highlighted):**
*   **Bar Data:** Loads OHLC data (now 71 bars), processes chronologically.
*   **State Tracking:** Standard PDS/PUS, CDS/CUS candidate tracking.
*   **Pattern Definitions (Key Custom Rules):**
    *   `is_your_custom_pds_rule(curr, prev)`: `curr.H <= prev.H AND curr.C < prev.O`
    *   `is_your_custom_pus_rule(curr, prev)`: `curr.L >= prev.L AND curr.C > prev.O`
    *   `is_custom_pds_rule_B(curr, prev)`: `curr.H <= prev.H`
    *   `is_custom_pus_rule_B(curr, prev)`: `curr.L >= prev.L`
    *   `check_custom_cds_confirmation_A(curr, prev, peak, all_bars)`: Confirms CDS if `curr.H > prev.H`, `curr.C > prev.C`, `no_higher_high` (intermediate bars vs peak), `curr.L < peak.L`, AND **a bar between peak (exclusive) and `prev_bar` (inclusive) made a low <= `peak.L` (`found_deep_enough_pullback`).**
    *   `check_custom_cds_confirmation_B(curr, prev, peak, all_bars)`: Confirms CDS if `curr.C > prev.C`, `curr.L >= prev.L`, `curr.H > peak.H`, `no_higher_high` (intermediate bars vs peak), AND **`found_deep_enough_pullback` condition (same as Rule A).**
    *   `check_custom_cus_confirmation_HHLL(curr, prev)`: Confirms CUS if `curr.H > prev.H AND curr.L < prev.L`.
    *   `check_custom_cus_confirmation_ref36(curr, pds_cand)`: `curr.L < pds_cand.L AND curr.H <= pds_cand.H`.
*   **Signal Detection Loop Highlights:**
    1.  **CDS Confirmation:**
        *   Order: `is_BRB`, then `check_custom_cds_confirmation_A`, then `check_custom_cds_confirmation_B`.
        *   If CDS via Rule A or B: PUS is set to existing PUS candidate if any, otherwise to the bar with the *lowest low* strictly between the confirmed CDS peak and `current_bar`.
    2.  **CUS Confirmation:**
        *   Order: `is_SDB`, `check_custom_cus_confirmation_ref36`, `check_custom_cus_confirmation_HHLL`.
        *   If CUS via HHLL: PDS is set on `current_bar`.
        *   If CUS via SDB/ref36: PDS might be set on the `cus_bar_object` if it's a better peak.
    3.  **New PDS/PUS Detection:** Standard SDB/SUB or custom rules A/B logic.
*   **Logging:** Includes bar index and date. Duplicate event strings per line are removed.

**Current Status of Matching Reference Log (up to Ref Line 46):**
*   **FULLY MATCHED!** The script output now aligns with the reference log provided up to line 46.
*   **Ref Log Line 40 PUS (Script Line 39):** Correctly identifies CDS Bar 33, PUS Bar 36. (Achieved by "lowest low after peak" PUS rule for CDS_A).
*   **Ref Log Line 42 (Script Line 42 "Neutral"):** Correctly neutral. This was fixed by adding the `found_deep_enough_pullback` condition to CDS Rules A and B, preventing a premature CDS of Bar 40.
*   **Ref Log Line 43 CUS (Script Line 43):** Correctly confirms CUS for Bar 36 and PDS for Bar 43. (Achieved by `check_custom_cus_confirmation_HHLL`).
*   **Ref Log Line 46 CDS/PUS (Script Line 46):** Correctly confirms CDS for Bar 43 and PUS for Bar 45. (Achieved by `check_custom_cds_confirmation_B` with the `found_deep_enough_pullback` and subsequent "lowest low" PUS logic).

**Key Logic Refinements Made:**
1.  **PUS after CDS (Rules A & B):** If no prior PUS candidate, PUS is the bar with the lowest low between the (CDS peak) and (current_bar, exclusive).
2.  **HHLL CUS Rule:** `current_bar.H > prev_bar.H AND current_bar.L < prev_bar.L` confirms prior PUS; `current_bar` becomes PDS.
3.  **`found_deep_enough_pullback` Precondition for CDS Rules A & B:** Both custom CDS confirmation rules now require that at least one bar between the PDS candidate (exclusive) and `prev_bar` (inclusive) must have made a low less than or equal to the PDS candidate's low. This prevents CDS confirmation if the trend showed immediate weakness (e.g., higher lows) after the PDS.

**To pick this up in a new chat, you can provide this summary. The script seems to be working correctly against the provided reference log up to line 46. Next steps would be to test against further reference data or explore new scenarios.**
