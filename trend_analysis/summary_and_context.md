Okay, here's a summary of our current status and context for a new chat:

**Goal:**
We are developing a Python script (`trend_analysis/trend_analyzer_alt.py`) to analyze OHLC bar data from `trend_analysis/data/CON.F.US.MES.M25_1d_ohlc.csv` against its reference log `trend_analysis/data/MES.M25_1D trend starts_with_dates.txt`.

**Current Script (`trend_analyzer_alt.py`) Logic Overview:**
*   **Bar Data:** 40 bars for MES data.
*   **Key Custom Rule Functions:** Includes CDS Rules A, B, F (with `found_deep_enough_pullback`), CDS Rule G (SUB-linked CDS), CDS Rule H (Outside Bar CDS). CUS Rules include SDB (with PDS context check), Ref36 (refined with `curr.c > prev.c`), HHLL (refined with `curr.c < curr.o`), and EngulfingUp (refined with PDS context check where `curr.l < pds_cand.l` is needed, else cond5 defaults to false).
*   **Signal Detection Loop (`process_trend_logic`):
    1.  **Snapshot Initial Candidates:** `initial_pus_candidate_idx` & `initial_pds_candidate_idx` stored.
    2.  **Evaluate CUS/CDS Possibilities:** Based on initial candidates and current rules.
    3.  **Apply Consequences (Priority: CUS first, then CDS):** Updates logs & state. Careful state management for PUS/PDS candidates and clearing, including PUS invalidation if PUS bar <= CDS bar.
    4.  **New PDS/PUS on `prev_bar`:** Refined conditions based on `confirmed_uptrend/downtrend_this_iteration` and `new_pds_on_curr_bar_this_iteration` (from PDS Rule C).
*   **PDS Rule C (Failed Rally):** If `curr.H > prev.H AND curr.C < curr.O`, `current_bar` can become PDS.
*   **PUS/CDS Interactions:** Detailed logic for PUS selection after CDS, PDS setting after CUS, and intelligent CUS candidate updates in BRB CDS path are in place.

**Current Status of Matching MES Reference Log:**
*   **Line 8 & 12 Corrected:** Correct PDS on Bar 7, leading to correct CDS Bar 7.
*   **Line 17 & 18 MATCHED:** Complex interaction for CDS 13, PUS 16, PDS 17, then CUS 16, CDS 17, PUS/PDS 18 resolved.
*   **Line 25 (Unwanted CUS 23):** FIXED. Line 25 is now Neutral.
*   **Line 26 MATCHED:** CDS Bar 19; PUS Bar 25.
*   **Line 28 CUS Bar 25:** Correctly occurs here now.
*   **Line 32 (Unwanted CUS 28):** FIXED. Line 32 is now Neutral. (Achieved by making EngulfingUp's Cond5 default to False if no PDS context).
*   **Line 34 MATCHED:** Events `CDS Bar 33; CUS Bar 25; PUS Bar 34; PDS Bar 34` (state for PDS 34 set, logs line 35) correctly processed.
*   **Remaining Discrepancies to Re-check / Address:**
    *   **Reference Log Line 5:** `Uptrend Start Confirmed for Bar 2`. Script previously matched this. Needs re-verification against all current rules.
    *   **Reference Log Lines 27-29 & 30-32 (PDS sequence):** Ref log shows `PDS on Bar 27`, `PDS on Bar 28`, `PDS on Bar 29`, then `PDS on Bar 30, 31, 32`. Script currently has `Neutral` for 27, (CUS 25 then) `Neutral` for 28, `PUS on Bar 28` for 29, and `Neutral` for 30, 31, 32. The rules for this PDS sequence in the reference log are not yet implemented in the script.

**Key Logic Refinements Added Recently:**
1.  **PDS Rule C (Failed Rally):** `curr.H > prev.H AND curr.C < curr.O` -> `current_bar` PDS.
2.  **CDS Rule H (Outside Bar):** `curr.H > prev_peak.H AND curr.L < prev_peak.L AND curr.C > prev_peak.C` -> CDS on `prev_peak`; PUS & PDS on `curr`.
3.  **Refined HHLL CUS Rule:** Requires `current_bar.c < current_bar.o`.
4.  **Refined EngulfingUp CUS Rule:** Requires PDS context for its 5th condition (`curr.l < pds_cand.l`), else condition is false.
5.  **Refined Ref36 CUS Rule:** Now requires `current_bar.c > prev_bar.c`.
6.  **SDB CUS Context Check:** Invalid if `curr.l < initial_pds_peak.l`.
7.  **Refined "New PDS/PUS on `prev_bar`" Block:** Conditions allow PDS/PUS on `prev_bar` more appropriately if CUS/CDS occurred for different bars or PDS Rule C didn't fire.
8.  **PUS Invalidation on CDS:** If a PUS candidate bar index is <= a newly confirmed CDS bar index, the PUS candidate is cleared.

**To pick this up in a new chat, provide this summary. Next step is to re-verify the entire MES log from the beginning, focusing on Line 5 CUS and the PDS sequence from lines 27-32.**
