Okay, here's a summary of our current status and context for a new chat:

**Goal:**
We are developing a Python script (`trend_analysis/trend_analyzer_alt.py`) to analyze OHLC bar data from `trend_analysis/data/CON.F.US.MES.M25_1d_ohlc.csv` against its reference log `trend_analysis/data/MES.M25_1D trend starts_with_dates.txt`.

**Current Script (`trend_analyzer_alt.py`) Logic Overview:**
*   **Bar Data:** 40 bars for MES data.
*   **Key Custom Rules:** Includes CDS Rules A, B, F (with `found_deep_enough_pullback`), CDS Rule G (SUB-linked CDS), CDS Rule H (Outside Bar CDS), CUS Rule HHLL (now requires `curr.c < curr.o`), CUS Rule ref36.
*   **Signal Detection Loop (`process_trend_logic`):
    1.  **Snapshot Initial Candidates:** `initial_pus_candidate_idx` & `initial_pds_candidate_idx` stored.
    2.  **Evaluate CUS/CDS Possibilities:** Based on initial candidates and current rules.
    3.  **Apply Consequences (Priority: CUS first, then CDS):** Updates logs & state. Careful state management for PUS/PDS candidates and clearing.
    4.  **New PDS/PUS on `prev_bar`:** This section was refined. PDS on `prev_bar` runs if `not confirmed_downtrend_this_iteration AND not new_pds_on_curr_bar_this_iteration` (where `new_pds_on_curr_bar_this_iteration` is from PDS Rule C - Failed Rally). PUS on `prev_bar` runs if `not confirmed_uptrend_this_iteration AND not new_pds_on_curr_bar_this_iteration`.
*   **PDS Rule C (Failed Rally):** If `curr.H > prev.H AND curr.C < curr.O`, `current_bar` can become PDS.
*   **PUS/CDS Interactions:** Logic for PUS selection after CDS, PDS setting after CUS, and intelligent CUS candidate updates in BRB CDS path are in place.

**Current Status of Matching MES Reference Log:**
*   **Line 8 & 12 Corrected:** Script now correctly identifies PDS on Bar 7 at line 8 (due to refined conditions for the "New PDS/PUS on `prev_bar`" block), leading to the correct CDS for Bar 7 at line 12 (instead of Bar 8).
*   **Line 17 MATCHED:** (CDS Bar 13; PUS Bar 16; PDS Bar 17) - Achieved with CDS Rule F.
*   **Line 18 MATCHED:** (CUS Bar 16; CDS Bar 17; PDS Bar 18; PUS Bar 18) - Achieved by prioritizing CUS over CDS confirmation using candidate snapshotting.
*   **Line 26 MATCHED:** (CDS Bar 19; PUS Bar 25) - Achieved with CDS Rule G.
*   **Line 28 Corrected:** Unwanted CUS of Bar 25 (by HHLL) was removed by making HHLL require `curr.c < curr.o`.
*   **Line 33 & 34 Corrected:** PDS on Bar 33 (by new PDS Rule C) and subsequent CDS on Bar 33 / PUS & PDS on Bar 34 (by new CDS Rule H - Outside Bar) now match reference.
*   **Remaining Discrepancies to Re-check:**
    *   Reference Log Line 5: `Uptrend Start Confirmed for Bar 2`. Script previously matched this, but the rule interaction was complex. Needs re-verification with latest full logic.
    *   Reference Log Lines 27-29: Show PDS on Bars 27, 28, 29. Script had `Neutral` for these after the HHLL CUS fix for line 28. The cause of these PDS signals in the reference needs to be identified and implemented if they are still missing.

**Key Logic Refinements Added Recently:**
1.  **PDS Rule C (Failed Rally):** `curr.H > prev.H AND curr.C < curr.O` -> `current_bar` PDS.
2.  **CDS Rule H (Outside Bar):** `curr.H > prev_peak.H AND curr.L < prev_peak.L AND curr.C > prev_peak.C` -> CDS on `prev_peak`; PUS & PDS on `curr`.
3.  **Refined HHLL CUS Rule:** Now also requires `current_bar.c < current_bar.o`.
4.  **Refined "New PDS/PUS on `prev_bar`" Block:** Conditions for running PDS and PUS checks on `prev_bar` are now more nuanced based on whether a CDS/CUS or PDS_Rule_C occurred for `current_bar`.

**To pick this up in a new chat, provide this summary. Next step is to re-verify the entire MES log from the beginning with the current `trend_analyzer_alt.py` to ensure overall consistency and address any remaining or newly introduced discrepancies, particularly around lines 5 and 27-29.**
