Okay, here's a summary of our current status and context for a new chat:

**Goal:**
We are developing a Python script (`trend_analysis/trend_analyzer.py`) to analyze OHLC bar data from a CSV (`data/MNQ Bar Data(2019-05-06 - 2019-06-28).csv`, recently extended with a new bar). The script aims to identify and log "Potential" and "Confirmed" trend starts (uptrends and downtrends) for each bar. The target output is to match a manually created reference log (`data/MNQ bar count trend starts.txt`) that specifies these events along with bar numbers and dates.

**Current Script Logic Overview (Key Changes Highlighted):**
*   **Bar Data:** Loads OHLC data (now 42 bars), processes chronologically.
*   **State Tracking:** Maintains state for current Potential Downtrend Signals (PDS), Potential Uptrend Signals (PUS), and candidates for Confirmed Downtrend Starts (CDS) and Confirmed Uptrend Starts (CUS).
*   **Pattern Definitions:**
    *   Basic: `is_SDB` (Simple Down Bar), `is_SUB` (Simple Up Bar), `is_BRB` (Bullish Reversal Bar for one type of CDS), `is_BeRB`.
    *   User-Defined (Custom Rule A for PDS/PUS):
        *   `is_your_custom_pds_rule(curr, prev)`: `curr.H <= prev.H AND curr.C < prev.O`
        *   `is_your_custom_pus_rule(curr, prev)`: `curr.L >= prev.L AND curr.C > prev.O`
    *   User-Defined (Custom Rule B for PDS/PUS):
        *   `is_custom_pds_rule_B(curr, prev)`: `curr.H <= prev.H`
        *   `is_custom_pus_rule_B(curr, prev)`: `curr.L >= prev.L`
*   **Signal Detection Loop (for each `current_bar` vs `prev_bar`):**
    1.  **CDS Confirmation:**
        *   `is_BRB` rule: PUS on `current_bar`.
        *   `check_custom_cds_confirmation_A` rule:
            *   If existing PUS candidate, use it.
            *   **If no existing PUS candidate: PUS is set to the bar with the *lowest low* strictly between the confirmed CDS peak and the `current_bar` (trigger bar).** (This was the recent successful change).
    2.  **CUS Confirmation:**
        *   Checks if `is_SDB(curr, prev)` OR `check_custom_cus_confirmation_ref36(curr, pds_cand)` confirms the `confirmed_uptrend_candidate_low_bar_index`.
    3.  **New PDS/PUS Detection:**
        *   If `is_SDB or is_your_custom_pds_rule or is_custom_pds_rule_B`:
            *   Sets active PDS signal on `prev_bar`.
            *   Updates `confirmed_downtrend_candidate_peak_bar_index` to `prev_bar` ONLY IF `prev_bar.H` is greater than current candidate's high (or no candidate).
            *   Logs "Potential Downtrend Signal on `prev_bar`" ONLY IF `prev_bar` became the new best candidate.
            *   Clears active PUS signal (not PUS candidate).
        *   `elif is_SUB or is_your_custom_pus_rule or is_custom_pus_rule_B`: (Symmetrical logic for PUS).
*   **Logging:** Output includes bar index and date. Duplicate event strings per line are removed.

**Current Status of Matching Reference Log:**
*   Many confirmed starts up to around Ref Log line 28 / Script line 28 are matching well.
*   **Ref Log Line 40 PUS MATCHED:** The script now correctly identifies Bar 33 (2019-06-20) as CDS and subsequently sets Bar 36 (2019-06-25) as PUS at script line 39 (when Bar 39 / 2019-06-28 closes). This was achieved by implementing the "lowest low after peak" rule for PUS selection in the `check_custom_cds_confirmation_A` path when no prior PUS candidate existed.
*   The stricter logging (only log PDS/PUS if it becomes a new best candidate) has aligned many "Neutral" lines correctly.
*   The "cascade" of CUS confirmations (where a CUS immediately becomes a PDS candidate) is generally handled.

**Key Remaining Discrepancy & Focus for Next Steps:**
The primary area of mismatch is now **Reference Log Line 43**:
1.  **Ref Line 43 CUS:**
    *   Your Log: `Bar 36 (2019-06-25) = Confirmed Uptrend Start`. This event in your log is triggered by the close of your reference "Bar 43". With the newly added data point in the CSV, this corresponds to the close of script's Bar 42 (2019-07-05).
    *   Script: At its line 42 (processing the close of Bar 42 / 2019-07-05), the script outputs "Neutral". It does **not** confirm CUS for Bar 36.
    *   **Current State:** Bar 36 (2019-06-25) is correctly a PUS candidate (`state.confirmed_uptrend_candidate_low_bar_index = 36`) in the script when Bar 42 (2019-07-05) is `current_bar` and Bar 41 (2019-07-02) is `prev_bar`.
    *   **Issue:** The existing CUS confirmation conditions (`is_SDB(current_bar, prev_bar)` or `check_custom_cus_confirmation_ref36`) are not being met for Bar 42 and Bar 41 to confirm CUS for Bar 36.
        *   `is_SDB(Bar 42, Bar 41)` is false.
        *   `check_custom_cus_confirmation_ref36` is likely false or not the intended trigger here as it usually relates to undercutting a PDS candidate.

**To pick this up in a new chat, you can provide this summary and state that the immediate next step is to define and implement the specific rule/conditions that should trigger a "Confirmed Uptrend Start" (CUS) for Bar 36 (2019-06-25) when Bar 42 (2019-07-05) closes, based on the relationship between Bar 42 (current), Bar 41 (previous), and/or Bar 36 (the PUS candidate).**
