# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Time-Travel Debugging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement debugging tools that allow replaying specific backtest scenarios
# Details:
Record all state changes during backtesting and create an interface to replay the backtest from any point. Allow stepping forward/backward through bars and inspecting state at each point. This should replace console.log debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Run a backtest, use time-travel to go to specific bars, and verify the state matches what was recorded during the original run.
