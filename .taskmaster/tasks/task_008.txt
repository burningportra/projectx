# Task ID: 8
# Title: Refactor Strategy Base Class
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert strategies to pure functions without internal state
# Details:
Refactor the BaseStrategy class to remove all internal state. Strategies should be pure functions that take the current state and bar data as input and return signals/orders as output. This makes strategies easier to test and reason about.

# Test Strategy:
Test that strategies produce deterministic output given the same input state and bar data. Verify no internal state is maintained.
