# Task ID: 3
# Title: Phase 3: UI/DX and Live Trading Abstraction
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement React Context provider, TypeScript strict mode, and common execution interface
# Details:
Create clean UI state management, eliminate all 'any' types, and define portable strategy interface for future live trading integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test React hooks, type safety compliance, and interface compatibility with both backtesting and future live trading scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement React Context Provider and Custom Hooks [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a React Context provider (BacktestProvider) and custom hooks (useBacktestState) for clean, reactive state management in the UI
### Details:
Create BacktestProvider that wraps the UI and provides access to backtest state. Implement hooks like useBacktestState, useBacktestActions, useBacktestResults. This eliminates manual state synchronization and props drilling while providing reactive updates to UI components.

## 2. Enforce TypeScript Strict Mode and Eliminate 'any' Types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enforce full TypeScript type safety by enabling strict mode and eliminating all 'any' types
### Details:
Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json and systematically replace all 'any' types with proper interfaces and types. Create comprehensive type definitions for all data structures, API responses, and component props. This ensures compile-time type safety and better IDE support.

## 3. Define Common IExecutionEngine Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a common IExecutionEngine interface to make strategy logic portable between the backtester and future live trading environments
### Details:
Create a unified interface that both BacktestEngine and future LiveTradingEngine will implement. This interface should expose common methods like submitOrder, getPositions, getAccountBalance, etc. Ensures strategies can run identically in both environments with just different engine implementations.
