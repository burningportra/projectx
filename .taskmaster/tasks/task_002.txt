# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Bracket Order Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add first-class support for bracket orders (entry + stop loss + take profit) with a single method call
# Details:
Create a BracketOrder interface and implement a createBracketOrder method that handles all three orders (entry, stop loss, take profit) atomically. This should eliminate the need for custom properties on trade objects and manual order linking.

# Test Strategy:
Test bracket order creation, ensure all three orders are linked correctly, and verify that filling/cancelling one order properly affects the others.
