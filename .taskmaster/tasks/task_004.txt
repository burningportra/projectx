# Task ID: 4
# Title: Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create BacktestRunner for parameter optimization and implement time-travel debugging
# Details:
Build parameter sweep orchestration and state snapshotting/replay functionality for debugging complex backtests.

# Test Strategy:
Test parameter grid execution, state snapshot consistency, and replay accuracy across different scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create BacktestRunner for Parameter Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a BacktestRunner class capable of orchestrating parameter optimization sweeps across a grid of strategy inputs
### Details:
Build a class that can run multiple backtests with different parameter combinations to find optimal strategy settings. Must support: parameter grids, parallel execution, progress reporting, result aggregation, and performance metrics comparison. Should handle both single-parameter and multi-parameter optimization.

## 2. Implement Time-Travel Debugging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement time-travel debugging within the engine, with state snapshotting and replay functionality
### Details:
Build debugging capabilities that allow stepping through backtest execution step-by-step. Must include: state snapshots at each bar/tick, ability to replay from any point, state inspection tools, and debugging UI components. This helps developers understand strategy behavior and debug complex scenarios.
