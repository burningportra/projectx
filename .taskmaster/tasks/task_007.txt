# Task ID: 7
# Title: Optimize Order Matching Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement indexed data structures and efficient algorithms for order matching
# Details:
Replace linear searches through orders with indexed data structures (Map by price, Map by time). Implement efficient algorithms for finding orders that can be filled at current prices. Add performance metrics to measure improvement.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark order matching performance with 10,000+ orders and verify at least 2x performance improvement over current implementation.
