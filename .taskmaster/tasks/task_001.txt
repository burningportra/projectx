# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Unified BacktestEngine Class
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a single BacktestEngine class that serves as the source of truth for all state management
# Details:
Create a new BacktestEngine class that consolidates all state management from OrderManager, Strategy, and UI components. This class should manage orders, positions, trades, and all state transitions through a clean API. All state changes must go through this engine to ensure consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the BacktestEngine with mock data to ensure state transitions work correctly. Test order submission, position tracking, and trade completion flows.
