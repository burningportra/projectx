# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Incremental State Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize state calculations to only process changes instead of full recalculation
# Details:
Implement a delta-based state update system that only recalculates what has changed since the last bar. This should significantly improve performance for long backtests with many trades.

# Test Strategy:
Compare performance of incremental updates vs full recalculation on a 10,000 bar backtest with 1000+ trades.
