# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a declarative API for defining strategies without boilerplate code
# Details:
Design a declarative configuration format for strategies that allows defining entry/exit signals, order types, and risk management rules without writing imperative code. Create a strategy builder that generates the implementation from the configuration.
